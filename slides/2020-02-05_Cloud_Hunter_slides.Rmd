## Theme: Data-driven decision making


## Introduction: The problem

The Cloud Hunter’s basic problem is to decide how to allocate a limited budget of flight time over the course of a field season. 

Decisions must be made 1 day ahead, based on imperfect day-ahead forecasts of whether conditions are good or bad.

###

#### Their current decision-making process:

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('slides','graphics','scientists_arguing.png'))
```

###

#### Our proposed decision-making process:

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('slides','graphics','The_Creation_of_Adam.png'))
```



## Formal model of the decision problem



### Model setup

$D$ : length of the field season in days

$F \leq D$ : number of flights in the Cloud Hunter’s budget. 

$d = D, \ldots, 1$ : index of dates

$f = F, \ldots, 1$ : index of flights remaining in budget

$X_d$ : binary random state variable indicating quality of conditions for data collection: 

 * $X_d = 1$ if conditions on date $d$ are good, 0 otherwise
 * $x_d$ : realized value of $X_d$

###

$a_d$ :  binary control variable 

* $a_d = 1$ iff they opt to fly on date $d$, 0 otherwise

$\bf{X} =  < X_D, . . . , X_1>$ : conditions on dates $d = D, \ldots, 1$

$\bf{a} =  < a_D, . . . , a_1>$ : actions chosen on dates $d = D, \ldots, 1$


### Objectives



Choose $\bf{a}$ to 
$$max_{\bf{a}} E[\bf{a} \cdot \bf{X}]$$


### Decision taken on basis of day-ahead forecast

Before taking each decision, decision-maker receives a forecast signal $s_d \in \mathbb{S}$.

Based on a calibrated prediction model, can map this signal to a probability of good conditions:

$$p(s) =  \Pr\{X_d = 1 | s_d = s\}$$.


## Distribution of forecast signals

$\pi(s)$ : unconditional probability that forecast will take value $s$. 

$\pi(\cdot)$ defines a probability distribution over the set $\mathbb{S}$ of possible forecast signals.

## Intertemporal optimization via dynamic programming

Dark line : simulated sequence of flight decisions

  * Diagonal movements = fly dates, horizontal movements  = no-fly dates

knitr::include_graphics(here('slides','graphics','algorithm_performance.png'))
```


The algorithm achieves a 21% increase in the number of successful flights.

```



Successes are flights launched on days with good conditions. 

Type I errors are decisions to fly only to find no clouds.

Type II errors are decisions to stand down only to find that the desired conditions existed.
