# FAQs

## Can we do a project as a team?

Yes, but with conditions.

*Your team must be self-organizaing.* You form your own team
voluntarily.

*Don’t bring the instructor any drama.* In group interactions, frictions
can sometimes arise. Sorting out such frictions is entirely the
responsibility of the team members themselves. It will not be
appropriate to ask the instructor to sort out intra-team dynamics. If
(say) one team member is not performing his fair share of the work, that
is a shame - but it is no one else’s responsibility. All team work will
be submitted jointly and graded equally.
